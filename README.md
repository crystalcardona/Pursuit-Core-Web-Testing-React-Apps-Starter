# Pursuit-Core-Web-Testing-React-Apps Starter App

> âš  The `master` branch has the starter code and has not tests or setup in it. `tested-app` has all tests implemented and `tests-written-during-class` has partial tests, these are the branches you want to use for your reference and review.

You might remember this app from your React Props Lab

## Testing
Our job will be to fully test this App using the Testing Library and Jest
